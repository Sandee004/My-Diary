# My-Diary
Testing my knowledge of Flask/Python and little JavaScript. I'll be using HTML and CSS for the interactive/GUI aspect.

## Documentation
* Problem:
    Replit pushes all it dependencies along with code when working on Flask or supposedly any Python framework.<br>
Solution:
    Made a gitignore file from Replit before intial commit so it doesn't track the dependencies at all.

* Problem:
    404 error when trying to connect my css file when using return
Solution:
    Css file can't be connected when using a return statement. As alternative you can use render_template or f.open()
